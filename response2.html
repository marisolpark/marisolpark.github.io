            <p>In “Ways of Seeing 1” it was intriguing to learn how the creation of the camera completely changed the way people see and consume art. Photographs/representations of paintings could now be put in different surroundings, its meaning could be changed, and its presence would be different. It was also interesting to see how the meaning or interpretation of a piece could drastically change when mixing it with sound, movement, the context of the painting, and our own knowledge about certain topics. It was also interesting to think about how the authenticity of the painting is so important to people, how the value of a piece of art greatly depends on it being original more than anything. </p>

            <p>In “Ways of Seeing 2”  I enjoyed thinking about the difference between being “nude” and being “naked”, as I have always thought about them the same way. For me it was a new perspective to think of being naked as showing a person's real self, while being nude ment being without clothes but still not showing their true self as there were viewers, mostly men,  who were judging women as objects. I was also intrigued by the conversation between the women where they talked about how a woman does not necessarily need to be without clothes to be naked; they could be still clothes yet still showing their true self for no viewer.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In “Ways of Seeing 3” it was interesting to learn about how people would use oil painting as a symbol of status for the buyer. The paintings were used to flaunt the wealth of the owner by showing the merchandise, belongings, cattle, and land of the buyers. I was amazed to hear how the way these objects were described was the same dehumanizing description used on paintings of nude women.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In “Ways of Seeing 4” I was amazed by the similarities between photographs used for advertisement and Western paintings. Some of the aspects that they would share were gestures, symbols, poses, and more, yet they were fundamentally different as one was meant to show what the owner already had, while on the other hand, the other showed the viewer what they wanted to have.  </p>
